41.*COMPREHENSION &PASSAGE 1&A new chairman had just been elected in our Local Government Area. As part of his 'know-the-people' tour, he had promised to visit only one secondary school and primary school. The new Chairman had earlier held at least two public offices and was known to donate generously to his hosts whenever he was on official visit.&Our joy therefore knew no bounds when the Headmaster announced at a morning assembly that our school had been chosen as the only primary school to be visited by the Chairman. Beaming with satisfaction, he explained that the choice of our school was a matter of sheer luck as the Chairman told no one why he decided to visit a school that was not in any way special. 'Only a fortnight separates us from the Chairman's visit and we must leave no stone unturned in our preparations to host him. You and your parents know that we need a lot of money to do some work in this school. Here comes our long-awaited opportunity'. He concluded.&We started preparing for the visit immediately. Each of us was to dress in a neat, starched and well-ironed uniform with a pair of white tennis shoes to match. We were also to get our hair and finger-nails properly cut. Any pupil who appeared rough on the day of the Chairman visit would be sent home immediately.&Then the day came for the great visit. We were lined on both sides of the untarred road that connects our village (where the school is located) to the only tarred road in our Local Government Area. Our teachers and parents were becoming impatient when as at 2:15pm, there was still no sign of the Chairman's arrival. We were very thirsty, hungry and tired but we dared not go for refreshment because of the warning that we must not disorganize our lines. &At 2:46pm, our Headmaster, who had gone to bring the Chairman, came back alone. The Chairman had been invited to Abuja for a very important meeting and his visit to our school had been postponed indefinitely&&The passage is mainly#
